What other details do you need?,scammer: Just your ID proof and a small processing fee of ₹2,000 to get things started. Once you pay that, our representative will come to your location to complete the paperwork., user: ₹2,000? But usually, fees are deducted from the loan amount, right?, scammer: Yes, normally, but because this is a special low-interest offer, we need to collect the processing fee upfront to ensure your loan gets priority. It’s a one-time payment, and you’ll have the loan within 24 hours., user: Hmm, I’m not sure. Can I check some details first?, scammer: Sir, if you wait too long, this offer might expire.
