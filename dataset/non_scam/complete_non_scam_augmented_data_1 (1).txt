How would you like to settle, through card or budget app?\n\nCustomer: I'll use my budgeting app, but it's prompting me to adjust my monthly spending limits before I can proceed. Can you assist with this?\n\nSalesperson: Of course, ma'am. If you're having trouble, try connecting to our free Wi-Fi. It usually helps users to navigate seamlessly through transactions.\n\nCustomer: I'll give it a shot. But can you walk me through the remedies I can take for this predicament?\n\nSalesperson: Certainly, ma'am. Once connected, open your budgeting app. Look for the section that deals with spending limits and tap on it. You can adjust the limits to accommodate the purchase. If you have any issues, don't hesitate to ask for help. \n\nCustomer: I'm in the adjustment section now. But the app is asking me to enter my password again for verification. What should I do?\n\nSalesperson: That's perfectly normal, ma'am. Simply enter your password as requested. If you get stuck again, remember I'm here to help.\n\nCustomer: I've entered the password. Now the app is asking me to input my one-time pin. What's that?\n\nSalesperson: It's an additional level of security famously called 'OTP'. You should have received it on your mobile phone. Just enter that unique code to proceed.\n\nCustomer: I've milked it in! It seems to be going well now. But it's asking me to confirm the transaction. \n\nSalesperson: Well done, ma'am! Confirm the transaction by tapping on the 'confirm' button. This confirms your purchase and allows the app to deduct the funds from your account.\n\nCustomer: I\u2019ve confirmed it. Should I get any transaction alert or notification?\n\nSalesperson: You will, ma\u2019am. It could be a text message, mobile notification or an email. Let me know If you don\u2019t receive one within a few minutes. \n\nCustomer: Alright. Thanks. I hope the transaction shows up soon.\n\nSalesperson: Of course, ma\u2019am. Don\u2019t worry. If it doesn\u2019t show up, you can check it through the app or call our customer service team for assistance. Now, have a great day. \n\nCustomer: Thank you and I hope the shopping was worth good too."

I\u2019m pleased to inform you about winning our jackpot prize of \u20b910 lakh! User: Hi, this is Raju. I was contacted about claiming the jackpot.\" The rewritten version added another constraint/requirement, making it more complex: \"Representative: Hi Raju, I'm Pankaj from ABC. Congratulations, you won a \u20b910 lakh jackpot prize and stand a chance to participate in a special bonus event.\" The rewritten prompt has the additional information about the special bonus event, making it slightly more complex but still understandable for humans.\n\nPart #2: Maintaining the possibility of a response from AI systems.\nUsage: The rewritten prompt should still be able to be responded by AI tools like ChatGPT and GPT4. For instance, the rewritten prompt \"Representative: Hi Raju, I'm Pankaj from ABC. Congratulations, you won a \u20b910 lakh jackpot prize and stand a chance to participate in a special bonus event.\" is a plausible scenario that such AI systems could respond to.\n\nPart #3: Not omitting non-text parts.\nUsage: The rewritten prompt adheres to this rule because it doesn't omit any non-textual elements present in the original prompt, such as names or any specific currency (\u20b910 lakh).\n\nPart #4: Complicating without making the prompt overly verbose.\nUsage: \"Representative: Hi Raju, I'm Pankaj from ABC. Congratulations, you won a \u20b910 lakh jackpot prize and stand a chance to participate in a special bonus event.\" This rewritten prompt added only few words to make it slightly more complex.\n\nPart #5: No-show keywords in the rewritten prompt.\nUsage: The rewritten prompt \"Representative: Hi Raju, I'm Pankaj from ABC. Congratulations, you won a \u20b910 lakh jackpot prize and stand a chance to participate in a special bonus event.\" does not contain the no-show keyword '#The Given Prompt#', '#Rewritten Prompt#', 'given prompt', and 'rewritten prompt'."
